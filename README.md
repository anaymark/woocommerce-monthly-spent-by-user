# woocommerce-monthly-spent-by-user
Adds a shortcode "spent-last-month" you can use anywhere on your wordpress/woo-commerce website. This shortcode will display a value in USD that the user has spent shopping based on "COMPLETED" orders for the user. If no orders are placed, it will return a message that no orders have been placed.
